**Peer-Graded Assignment: Final Assignment â€“ Part 1**
Assignment Scenario

As a regional manager for a chain of car dealerships you need to create some visualizations to allow you to understand your car sales and profits for each dealer.

**Tasks to perform:**

Create visualizations for the following captured KPI metrics:
- 'Quantity Sold' by 'Dealer ID' - as a bar chart, sorted in either ascending or descending order of quantity sold, and change the chart title to "Quantity Sold by Dealer ID" 
- 'Profit' by 'Date' and 'Model' - as a line chart, and give the chart a title of "Profit by Date and Model" 
- 'Profit' by 'Year' and 'Dealer ID' - as a column chart, titled "Profit by Year and Dealer ID" with the data columns in red
- 'Sum of Profits' for 'Hudson model cars' by 'Dealer ID' - as a line chart, titled "Profit of Hudson Models by Dealer ID". Also remove the horizontal gridlines from the chart, put the legend on the right side of the chart, and color the series outline in green.
- Save your workbook: Use 'Save As' to save your completed workbook as CarSalesByModelEnd.xlsx
